  <p>

    firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant and a merry
    band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy
    investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in
    a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on
    his empire of excess.
